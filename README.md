# MSAL Authentication with Angular 7, Ngrx and Unit Tests

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zymplsi/ngrx-msal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zymplsi/ngrx-msal)

This starter project uses NgRx side effects to make MSAL API calls for authentication of Microsoft account users (MSA) or enterprise users using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD).

Code scaffolding is done via Angular CLI and NgRx Schematics to avoid writing common boilerplate. Check the cheatsheet.md file for sample cli commands used to scaffold this project.

Unit tests include marble testing the store actions, effects and selectors with setup for Travis CI .
